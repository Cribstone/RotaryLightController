Neopixel: day through night by turning a knob
=============================================

##Control a Neopixel addressable RGB strip with a potentiometer (WS2812 LEDs) with an Arduino Uno

On a 120 pixel strip, every pixel has a defined color. Turning a knob will move the position of an array of n pixels that are turned on - the others are switched off.

Colors are defined 1 to 60 and then backwards again. (hence the 'library' only consists of 60 colors)

Purpose of this code is to provide lighting to a diorama of a landscape in a plate.
The viewer can turn a knob, potentiometer, that changes the direction and color,
following a night to day to night course.

To run this code you will also need to install the Adafruit Neopixel Library:

The hardware setup can be seen on the breadboard image made with Fritzing.
Remember to adjust the Pin you connect the data input to and number of pixels you have in your setup in the .ino file. The small ino file is documented, and pretty straightforward.

Also, as can be read in the tutorials on the strip (see links below), take care of using the right power for your project. And protect the setup by using a capacitor. Possibly the 5V and the Amps supplied by the USB port might be sufficient because this code only lights up 11 pixels. But powering the full 120 pixels is probably a no go.

In the Arduino code the global brightness is defined by:
*leds.setBrightness(32); // Set global brightness for the whole strip 0-255*
In other words: pump it up to 255 if you want full power. When breadboarding/prototyping I found it easier to see the colors when they're less bright. In an actual setup, or when diffused you might want to crank them up again.

To Do:
I was thinking that dimming the outer LEDs of the 11-pixel array would provide an even smoother transition. But so far that hasn't worked yet. And in prototyping for our work, it's not clear yet whether it would make any real difference.

I also got great help by the user Grumpy_Mike (Mike Cook) on the Arduino forum who has spent a great deal of time on rewriting and simplifying my code:

He has some valuable tutorials and info about Arduino and electronics on his website http://www.thebox.myzen.co.uk/
